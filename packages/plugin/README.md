# Spine plugin prompt configuration

Pi loads its prompt configuration from `spine.toml` in this package. This file
overrides the embedded `spine-core` prompt defaults, so updating the shared WASM
artifact alone does not update Pi's configured wording.

Each extension activation reads one configuration snapshot for its tool catalog
and default runtime. Tree navigation reuses it; `/new` and reload read the file
again. A custom runtime factory remains responsible for its own configuration.

The default node body is empty. Each projected `<spine_node>` still includes
its identity, summary, and stable status; the global JIT prompt explains those
boundaries once. An explicit nonempty `prompt.node` remains supported. Tool
descriptions retain the operation and returned-memory guidance.

Pi and SpineCodex now use the v6 recursive-call policy: each branch owns an
outcome, Close returns one level, and new work begins under its direct owner.
The global policy and Open/Close/Next descriptions are synchronized, with host
tool names adapted. Node bodies remain empty; Spawn and parameter schemas are
unchanged. The v6 Pi training and unseen-task PoC passed the exercised ownership
and return cases; repeated memory and broader lifecycle coverage remain limits.

## Pi SDK installation and updates

This package is the SDK-backed Pi SpineJIT extension. Its Pi manifest and package
export both select `dist/pi/extension.js`, which is included in the package.
The native Pi implementation is a separate project.

From this repository's root, build the TypeScript packages in dependency order:

```bash
npm run build -w @spinejit/spine-sdk
npm run build -w @spinejit/spine-host
npm run build -w @spinejit/spine-plugin
pi install /absolute/path/to/spine-sdk-plugin/packages/plugin
```

After the public packages are released, users install only the Pi package; npm
resolves the matching SDK and host dependencies automatically:

```bash
pi install npm:@spinejit/spine-plugin
```

Local directory installation and packed installation use the same compiled
entry. After source changes, rebuild these packages, then `/reload` or restart
Pi and start a new session. A `spine.toml` wording change needs extension
reactivation, but does not require a TypeScript or WASM rebuild. Normal Pi
0.87.1 `/new` also reactivates extensions; a tree navigation is not a reload.

The package depends on matching SDK and host packages and Pi 0.87.1. In a local
checkout, workspace dependencies must already be installed. A packed consumer
must resolve those dependencies too; the plugin tarball does not bundle them.
Spawn's default child invocation passes the currently loaded extension module,
so the formal `dist` entry is also the explicit child entry.

## Runtime composition

`extendSystemPrompt(base)` composes an original host base with enabled Spine
prompt sections. Pass the original base for every call, not an earlier composed
result. The host text is preserved as supplied, including any literal examples
of Spine tags. Pi's sampling hook receives fresh original system options and
performs this composition once for the request.

## Local development build

The development `spine-core` source is fixed by `core-source.json` as SpineCodex
revision `cb01f18b0113ada388b0ede69b36c1194513a240` plus the versioned patch
`provenance/spine-core-cb01f18.patch`. The declaration records the full core
file inventory and hashes, including prompt composition fixes and the v6
configuration. It does not claim those changes are in the upstream commit.

Build with the repository's `scripts/build-node-wasm.sh`, an explicitly selected
shared Cargo target cache, and `wasm-bindgen 0.2.127`. The script produces
`packages/sdk/wasm/node/spine_wasm*`, loaded by `packages/sdk/dist/node.js`.
The script verifies the declared source before and after its locked Cargo build.
See the repository README for source reconstruction. Build evidence is recorded
in `tasks/sdk_review_branch_e2e_20260928_1232/evidence/core-provenance/`.
No release or publication is implied by this local development build.

## Provider message ordering

Spine node descriptors must stay at their projected positions in the conversation.
For an OpenAI Responses model that supports developer messages within the
conversation, set model compatibility `supportsMidConvoSystemMessages: true`.
Pi 0.87.1 otherwise hoists those messages into the initial system content,
rewriting the prefix when a node opens or closes. The local cachetree GPT
profiles now declare this capability. This setting must reflect provider
support; it is not enabled for models with unverified capabilities.

## Durable message order

Pi 0.87.1 can persist context-only custom messages after a turn without calling
extension message handlers. Before admitting a user or custom steering/follow-up
message, the plugin admits that durable tail first. Context preparation also
reconciles the tail. This preserves source order across sampling commits and
recovery, including a silent custom update followed by a queued custom message.
Assistant and tool-result events retain normal sampling order; they do not
trigger full replay while Spawn terminal staging may still be uncommitted.
